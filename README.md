# JsVanilla-MemoryGame

This is an application of a game, especifically a memory game, where you have to find all the pairs of numbers on the table. I believe you have played it at some point in time ðŸ˜œ <br>
The primary purpose of the application was to get a better understanding of JavaScript when I found my very first job, where JQuery, Lodash and Backbone were used. Since I would be getting enough experience with those tools by working, I decided to practice with JavaScript Vanilla days before joining my position, because it is the core starting point.


### Toolset

- JavaScript Vanilla <br>
- Bootstrap 5.2.0 <br>

### Results

Main menu of the game with 3 different modes:

### Improvements

In the near future, I would like to add more cool functionalities and make a migration from Js Vanilla to Js + React. Futhermore, add a good compatibility for mobile phones and tablets.
